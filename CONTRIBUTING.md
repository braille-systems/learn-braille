## Build
### Requirements
`android-studio >= 3.3`

Installation: see [developer.android.com/studio](https:://developer.android.com/studio)
For building and running the app, your either need to download a virtual Android device image (this can be done from within the Android Studio) or connect a physical device (with developer options enabled and USB debugging turned on) via USB cable.

### Setting up environement

Clone the repository and open 'android/' subfolder as an Android Studio project. Gradle build will start automatically and all libraries will be downloaded (an Internet connection is required). Then, if you have already set up an emulator or connected a physical device, you will be able to launch it (click green triangle screen button in the toolbar above the code editor).
