## Build

To work with the project you need `android-studio >= 3.3`, you can get it [here](https:://developer.android.com/studio).

For building and running the app, your either need to download a virtual Android device image (this can be done from within the Android Studio) or connect a physical device (with developer options enabled and USB debugging turned on) via USB cable.

## Git workflow

- Write short and informative commit messages. Start them with reference to issue (begins with `#`). [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Follow [a successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## Coding style

- Kotlin [coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) + Java [google style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) and [oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html).
- Also look around each time you do something new to see, how such thing was formatted and impelemented before.
- Set up Android Studio proper kotlin code style `editor -> code style -> kotlin -> set from -> predefined -> Kotlin style guide`.
- Apply autoformatting to edited files each time before commit.

## Adding content

There are handy DSL that allows write content in the typesafe way.

- All app content should be placed into `com.github.braillesystems.learnbraille.res` package.
- Use `DslTest.kt` file as DSL tutorial.

Symbols that are not from particular alphabet and does not exist on classical american keyboard should be treated as special and added via `enum class`.
