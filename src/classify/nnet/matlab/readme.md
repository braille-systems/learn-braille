# A simple two-layer neural network for two-class classification

- `MAIN.m` - loads data from `data2.txt`, trains and visualizes two-layer network with 
sigmoid units. Each layer is fully connected.
- `plotCostProjection.m` - additional script which changes two particular parameters of a neural network and plots 
cost function calculated with these weights. Run `MAIN` first to prepare a trained classifier.
