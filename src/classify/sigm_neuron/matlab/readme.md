# Logistic regression - two classes

This machine learning system design is a modification of the one that was placed
as an exercise in Andrew NG's Machine Learning on-line course.

- `MAIN.m`: initialize, train and visualize a two-class logistic regression classifier.
Uses  `data.txt` (training set), `sigmoid.m` (computes sigmoid function),
`predict.m` (given a parameter vector, computes an output of logistic regression),
`costFunction.m` (calculates cost function and gradients), `plotDecisionBoundary.m`
 (visualizes a trained classifier).
- `plotCostProjection.m`: additional vizualization. Sets two of three parameters
in a parameter vector to values in a specified range and plots cost function.
