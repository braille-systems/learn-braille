Learn Braille is an Android application for teaching the tactile writing system created
by Louis Braille.

It is one of the few apps primarily designed for the Russian Braille system, 
but also other systems could be easily added.

The app can be used with 
[Braille Trainer](https://github.com/braille-systems/braille-trainer)
and [tiles](https://github.com/braille-systems/braille-tiles)
or without them.
